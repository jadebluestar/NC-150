class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        PrevMap = {} #basically (val:index)

        for i,n in enumerate(nums):
            diff = target - n
            if diff in PrevMap:
                return [PrevMap[diff], i]
            PrevMap[n] = i #PrevMap is now {n: i}
        return[]


this is like a shorter solution
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        new_dict = {}
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if new_dict and (target - nums[i]) in new_dict:
                return [new_dict[target-nums[i]], i]
            new_dict[nums[i]] = i
